started playing with yahoo api...

21:19
api feels fine, but I need company list of NDS and their sector/industry, yahoo api seems not supporting it -_-!
checking source of the google project

21:30
Nah.. seems a overshoot. And confirmed by stack overflow that yahoo is not providing it ... scaper??

22:40
Okay!! find csv files that can has those information
just initialized a github repo
writing a ruby program that transform csv files to the form I want.

TODO: Design tables (anwser two required questions at leaset)
	  Create migration
	  Load data in~~~~


22:45
I was wrong.. it's actually easier to load data from csv to DBMS first and then transform inside dbms.
Creating database (local for now) 

24:01
drawn a ERD for the first version
created database and admin user
code is talking to database now

TODO:
	create table
	load company data in
	transfrom company data (only keep those 100)

11:30 ~ 13:49
finished popluating company table:D

Mar. 4th

10:40 ~ 12:31 
all table created
next let's load company data in~~
1:20
set up active record gave some hard time...
now ruby code can interact with database without using sql
next write a csv importor

18:33 ~ 19:52
csv importer finished
company table populated
next build yahoo impoter

20:43

the following api 
http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=WU&a=1&b=1&c=2010&d=1&e=31&f=2010&g=d&ignore=.csv
will return data for Feberary..

but if change the a=1 to a=0 and a=2 to a=1
then we will get Jan. data...

so yahoo api counts months from 0 to 11 instead of 1 to 12-_-!!!

20:58
